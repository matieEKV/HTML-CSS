        This was the second amigurumi I made for my son who was crazy about
        seals. We could not find the toy to buy so I decided to make it myself!
        This was 3 years ago and he still sleeps with it. You can use different
        types of wool to get different textures. The pattern can be bought on

          My love for crocheting grew exponentially with my kids. I decided to
          prove to myself that having two left hands (metaphorically) will not
          prevent me from making pretty looking crafts for my children. I have
          yet to prove that!
